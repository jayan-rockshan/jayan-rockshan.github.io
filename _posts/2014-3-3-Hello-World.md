## What are version controlling systems...
**Version control systems** are a category of software tools that help a software team,
- to track the changes done to the document since the beginning, 
- avoid overriding one's change by another one,
- to recover something you have deleted, 
- Undo the changes you have made during the last week, 
- Merge a paragraph deleted last month into the current document.


The same need exists in software development. Version controlling systems like "git" are well-known software solutions to solve the above needs. Almost every professional software developer uses one of the version controlling systems.
